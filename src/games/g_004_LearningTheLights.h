/**
  Learning The Lights
  ===================

    This is the fifth challenge from the original CleverPet learning curriculum.

    Only one touchpad is lit. This is the challenge where most players will
    start to "see the lights". If your player wasnâ€™t using the information
    provided by the lights on the previous challenge, they could expect to get
    rewarded about two-thirds of the time, just by chance. Now, chance is only 1
    in 3 guesses. The lights are twice as important as before!

    **Challenge logic:** This challenge has only 1 level. if 30 successful
    interactions were played in the last 50 games, the challenge is done (will
    reset). Every interaction, 1 random random target will be picked and
    compared with the pressed touchpad. The player's performance is recorded,
    and only correct presses count.  When an incorrect touchpad is pressed, the
    next interaction will be a redo interaction with the same target. There is a
    random between interactions pause ranging from 1 to 8 seconds
